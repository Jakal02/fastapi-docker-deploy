# fastapi-docker-deploy
Practice repo for dockerizing a fastapi app with a database connection

## Goals

This repo exists so I can practice creating a simple fastapi application, dockerize it, and deploy it to a cloud provider.

## Rough in-order TODO

- [X] Create a FastAPI app with only static routes.
- [X] Create a Dockerfile that runs the FastAPI app
- [ ] Get the Dockerfile Deployed in the cloud
        - Perhaps outside the scope of this repo
- [ ] Add a database to the FastAPI app
- [ ] Have the local app docker container communicate to a local db
- [ ] Figure out how to deploy the app and connect it to an existing DB
